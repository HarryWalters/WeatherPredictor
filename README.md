# Weather Predictor

Created by Harry Walters and Gabriel Muller

This project demonstrates how the application of a fully connected neural network can dramatically improve the predictive capabilities. Our weather predictor maintains a simple architecture for processing sequence data by making 'lagged' time data concurrent inputs; the past  5 days of weather conditions are used to predict the next day.

This project also demonstrates our web scraping, data cleaning and processing capabilities in the software package R.
